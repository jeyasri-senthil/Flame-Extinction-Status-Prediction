# ***Flame Extinction Status Prediction***

*Nowadays, innovative flame extinguishing techniques are still being 
sought that do not threaten the environment and do not damage the extinguished 
elements. One of them seems to be the ***Acoustic method***. A sound wave flame 
extinction system was developed in order to extinguish the flame at an early stage 
of the fire. Our ultimate aim is to predict whether the flame is extincted or not through 
machine learning methods.*

#### ***SHORT DESCRIPTION:***
*The dataset was obtained as a result of the extinguishing tests of Four different 
fuel flames with a sound wave extinguishing system. A total of ***17,442*** tests were 
conducted with this experimental setup. The dataset includes the features of fuel 
container size representing the ***Flame Size, Fuel Type, Frequency, Decibel, 
Distance, Airflow and Flame Extinction Status***.
The explanation of a total of 7 features for liquid fuels in the dataset is given 
in Table 1, and the explanation of 7 features for LPG fuel is given in Table 2. The 
***STATUS*** property (flame extinction or non-extinction states) can be predicted by 
using six features in the dataset. Status and Fuel features are categorical, while 
other features are numerical. 8,759 of the 17,442 results are the non-extinguishing 
state and 8,683 of them are the extinction state of the flame. According to these 
numbers, it can be said that the class distribution of the dataset is almost equal.
STATUS 0 indicates the non-extinction state, STATUS 1 indicates the extinction state.*
